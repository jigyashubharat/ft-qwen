1. Train this model on domain knowledge.
- relevant papers - 5G papers / research papers
- crux of datasets for all models - use good LLMs to generate this - Atul / Shubham
2. Run the model again on the training data
- data cleaning and segregation => separate input output tuples
- calculate loss
3. Finetuning with training data ??
- specifics to be discussed - Sanchit / Paras
- recheck loss
4. validation with test data
